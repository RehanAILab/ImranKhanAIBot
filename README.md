# Imran Khan AI Bot

Welcome to our AI bot project, inspired by the functionality of CallAnnie.ai, where we’ve brought a unique conversational experience for users by creating an interactive AI model with the avatar of Imran Khan.
In its initial phase, the bot will engage users in English, creating an experience of a virtual conversation with Imran Khan. The bot processes user queries and generates relevant responses, leveraging OpenAI’s advanced language model, supplemented by other premium and open-source APIs.
In future versions, we plan to include multilingual support, including Urdu, to make the bot accessible to a broader audience and ensure a more versatile conversational experience.
As we continue to develop and enhance this bot, we aim to provide a robust, enjoyable, and informative AI tool. Please explore our project, and we welcome your feedback and contributions.
